Panel itself is 2d, as are cut-outs.

Objects are 3D, implemented in front and behind for clearance + view purposes.
Only necessary objects are implemented.

Features are center co-ordinate based with a globally defined offset. This is
so a cut out, bracket and object can share the same reference easily.

# Conventions


# Include

Non-coherent part libraries dependent on main.scad.

Implementation for everything goes here, including views.

# Jigs


# Parts

Individual parts to manufacture, 2D or 3D as the manufacturing process
requires.

Normally just calling a module.

# Views

Normally just calling/assembling modules.
