Panel itself is 2d, as are cut-outs.

Objects are 3D, implemented in front and behind for clearance + view purposes.
Only necessary objects are implemented.

Features are center co-ordinate based with a globally defined offset. This is
so a cut out, bracket and object can share the same reference easily.
