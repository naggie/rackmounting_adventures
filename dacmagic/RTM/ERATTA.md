switch cutout 10mm -> 12mm

Switch holder plate face too thick, reduce or eliminate in future

M2.5 might become M3 but probably not

Thanks thatâ€™s, only the obround but I have fixed that. The 2 x 24.5 dia holes can they be 25 dia?

Also 2mm steel or 3mm alu? What better?

Lots of tool/retention marks needs:
Flattening, de-burring, sanding
Diamond needle files great for deburring/smoothing/blending -- can look bowed/non-square. Need to blend by eye, radius. Corners with round

Sandpaper mad huge difference. Perception influenced by how small distortions are amplified by the shiny surface.

320 for paint
